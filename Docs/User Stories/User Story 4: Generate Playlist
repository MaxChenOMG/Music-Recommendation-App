FINAL PRODUCT: We realized the free version of the Weather API we were using only accepts location as
parameters so we were only able to have Location as an input field. However, this location field finds
the weather, so it still generates music based on the weather of the location you are in. The inclusion
of personalization in music generation with the consideration of past preferences (liked songs) is an 
area we would love to develop in the future.


As a user, I want the system to recommend a playlist based on the following input information:
(1) Weather
(2) Location
(3) Past preferences (liked songs, etc)

The purpose of this web application is to generate a playlist of songs based on the weather and your location.
The user will first be prompted to input their location and the weather. This will be the basis from which 
the playlist is generated. If it is snowing in December, it will generate christmas music, if you are at a beach,
it will generate songs appropriate for the occasion. The application will generate one playlist and the user will have 
an option to look at each individual song and have the option to delete a song if it is not to their liking. 
Furthermore, the user will be given the opportunity to generate another playlist through a prompt that will 
appear on the view if they choose to do so. With the ability to like songs, the application will take into 
account what songs you like when generating the playlist.
