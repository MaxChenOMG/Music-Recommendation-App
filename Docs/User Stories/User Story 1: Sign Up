User Story: As a new user, I want to be able to create an account.

Description: 
When I am creating the account, I need to specify my:
  (1) username (for logging in) - should only contain alphanumericals, spaces (though no consecutive spaces), and special characters
  (2) email address - should end with a valid domain suffix
  (3) nickname (for display)
  (4) full name (optional)
  (5) password - should only contain alphanumeric and special characters.
  (6) confirmed password
If any of the above information is invalid, the system will not allow you to register, and will tell you which field is invalid and why it is invalid.
After I go back and correct them, I should be able to register successfully.
The system should record all the user information, encrypt the password, and store them in the backend database.
After the successful registration I will be taken to the main/home page of the application.

Optional: send the user an email, asking him/her to confirm the email address so that it could be used for password recovery.


FINAL PRODUCT: Because we are letting Spotify OAuth handle the authentication and authorization of users,
we realized there was no need on our end to implement a signup/signin portion and rather let Spotify
hande it. Aspects similar to our original user story will still be present but it would be accessed 
through the Spotify api.
