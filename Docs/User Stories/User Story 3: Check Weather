FINAL PRODUCT: We ended up only including a portion of the weather data we originally intended on 
having because we were given limited function calls in the free version of the weather API. Info we
were able to include were temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, and an overall weather description. 
As for verification, the weather API handles a lot of it so we were able to leverage that instead of
implementing it ourselves.


User Story: As a user I want to be able to be able to check the weather so 
that I know details like the temperature and humidity for the specified location.  

Description: I want to be able to see the details of the weather including 
percent chance of precipitation, heat index, temperature, uv index, and the 
wind so that I know what to expect for the day. The temperature will have 
the option of being shown in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. Some things that 
could go wrong is if I insert a nonexistent location or misspell a city name. 
If an invalid input is entered then the system will prompt me to check my spelling 
and re-input a valid location.
