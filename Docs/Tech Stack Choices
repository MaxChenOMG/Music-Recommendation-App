We've chosen Express.js on top of Node.js as the backend framework and EJS as the front end template.

We went for Express & Node.js because
(1) it is one of the most popular backend frameworks (has a large community and a plethora of libraries),
and (2) it is based on JavaScript, so the team members get to learn a new language.
We chose it over Django because it is not as popular (debatable) and most of us know Python already.

We went for EJS because it gets the job done and is easy to use (uses plain JS, no need for additional 
scripting/markup languages to complicate the codebase).

For the database we decided to go with MongoDB because we needed a document based database and MongoDB provides 
the scalability that we want for a longterm project. Another benefit is that it has a flexible schema
and doesn't require a lot of configuration.
