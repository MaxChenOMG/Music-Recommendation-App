Project idea #1: 

An application that generates a playlist (Spotify API) based on the weather, location, and time information (Microweather API). For example, around Christmas
time it will generate Christmas themed playlists while if its 90F in July it will generate a beach playlist. 

API for accessing weather: https://m3o.com/weather/overview 

API for accessing spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/



Project idea #2:
Idea: Extract repertoire or playlist from recent concerts, recital such as BSO, Boston Pop, Musical events, and generate the corresponding playlist for Spotify users. 

The Spotify API web link:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

The API to extract data from music events:

Project idea #3:
an application that retrieves news articles from sources like CNN, New York Times, and BBC, and then summarizes them into a few sentences for the end user.

API for accessing news articles and blogs from thousands of sources by MediaStack:
https://mediastack.com/

API for an AI that summarizes paragraphs into a few sentences by OpenAI.
https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-tldr-summary

Challenge 1: the MediaStack news API returns an URL to the news article (instead of text) and we'll have to find a way to import 
the actual article from the URL without importing garbage data like ads and UI texts. The alternative is to find another API that returns 
the article in plain text instead of an URL.
Challenge 2: The quality of summary by OpenAI might be subpar (compared to humans) - to be tested

Some other news APIs are listed here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#news
